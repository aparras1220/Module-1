# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
	As an overview we are using the data provided in the Kickstarter worksheet to filter and find out how a campaign will be successful. We are doing this specifically for the "plays" category so that we can discover the best method for launching a Kickstarter for a play. The project is to use the excel skills that I learned in the module to filter data and present it in a format that is easy to understand. By extracting the data we need and visualizing it, it provides us a clear picture of how to attain out goals with our Kickstarter for the play. 

### Purpose
	By extracting the data we need and visualizing it, it provides us a clear picture of how to attain out goals with our Kickstarter for the play. 

## Analysis and Challenges
	With the data about the different Kickstarters, I have separated out the information into two main categories, Theater Outcomes by Launch Date and Outcome based on Goals. The launch date will tell us around what time is the best for a Kickstarter and the Outcomes based on goals will show us realistic expectations based on historical data. Separating out the data we calculated the percentage of successful Kickstarters by group together the goals and then graphed both the goals and the Outcome by Launch date on a line graph. The graph will show up over time or over the categories how they fair for each field. While doing my analysis the challenge I came across was making sure I was using the right formulas and right data fields when filtering information into a readable format. There is a lot of information provided and it is very easy to use data that would not pertain to our end goal. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
	From the data I have graphed, we can surmize that for the best outcome we would want to have a play Kickstarted Launch in early summer. The historical data shows that the May and June both have high success number for Kickstarters, while the end of the year, the holiday season, has the most failed. This is likely due to the fact that with the summers, there is much freedom without the school year and then by the month of September, people are spending their money to prepare for the holidays.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
	 Plays also with smaller goals have been more successful, however that data is also skewed there are much more Kickstarts that range between $1,000 to $4,999. The Kickstarters with higher goals are exponentially lower but with such a large goal they would need a significant amount of donors or a high average donation amount.

## Results
	Based on the data we have created the we know that plays in the range of $10,000 to $14,999 only have a 54% chance of success. The best method would be to launch the Kickstarter in May as they have the highest number of success. 

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date? From the data I have graphed, we can surmize that for the best outcome we would want to have a play Kickstarted Launch in early summer. The historical data shows that the May and June both have high success number for Kickstarters, while the end of the year, the holiday season, has the most failed. This is likely due to the fact that with the summers, there is much freedom without the school year and then by the month of September, people are spending their money to prepare for the holidays.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?  Plays also with smaller goals have been more successful, however that data is also skewed there are much more Kickstarts that range between $1,000 to $4,999. The Kickstarters with higher goals are exponentially lower but with such a large goal they would need a significant amount of donors or a high average donation amount.

- What are some limitations of this dataset? 	While the information we have will undoubtable prove useful as we look to launch our Kickstarter, the data does have it limitations. The dataset we are using is over 4 years old so it would be more beneficial if we had a more recent dataset within the last year to truly gauge an accurate public response.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create? While the line graphs are great, a 3-set bar graph would have been my preferred method when reviewing the outcomes of the launch date over each month.
